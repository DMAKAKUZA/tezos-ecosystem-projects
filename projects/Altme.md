Altme is a robust decentralized identity (DID) solution that leverages the new digital identity standard established by the W3C. With the Altme wallet, Tezos users gain complete control over their personal data, enabling them to provide verifiable proof of identity, age, email and more within the web3 ecosystem, while protecting their privacy. By harnessing the power of Altme, Tezos applications can easily remain compliant with age, KYC / AML and GDPR regulations.
