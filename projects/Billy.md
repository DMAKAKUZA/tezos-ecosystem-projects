Billy's mission is to help event organizers grow their brand and engage their communities.

We believe that artists, producers and events organizers have the power to create moments we'll remember forever.

So, we created an event platform enabling them to:
- Control primary and secondary markets sales with a superpowered ticketing engine
- Transform their website into event shops to easily sell their experiences (tickets, merchandising, bundles...) and boost their sales
- Enhance their brand universe and own their customer user journey with white-label solutions
- Extend their capabilities using the tools they love with build-in interoperability and integrations
