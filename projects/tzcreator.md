TzCreator is a free toolkit, but more than that, itâ€™s an initiative to improve the Tezos art ecosystem for artists, collectors, and curators that is open and run by the community. Which is our long-term goal.

The guiding principle behind TzCreator is freedom: freedom to own, freedom to control, freedom to prove, freedom to choose, freedom to be borderless, and freedom to experiment.
